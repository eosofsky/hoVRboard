HoVRboard

Physics
Have a board in a scene taking in input from tracker
Got it to move forward and brake using forces
BUT
Forces does not seem to support turning
May need to simulate physics ourselves :(

Terrain
Built with the terrain editor
Still experimenting; terrain material, more trees, rocks, and other objects are to be modeled and applied.
Making it as bumpy as possible so the player would have fun while flying above it.
Created by the awesome Minsun & Rachel

Models
Edwardâ€™s fabulous rocks and trees

Physical Model
Got materials from Home Depot
Have a board prototype
